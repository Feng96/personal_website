# Research & Intern

- **Intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)**  
  _May 2025 – Aug 2025_  
  At the Geographic Information Science and Technology Group (GIST), Oak Ridge National Laboratory  
  > - Integrated and standardized multiple building footprint datasets into the AutoBEM (Automatic Building Energy Modeling) input format. Analyzed how variations in building footprints affect energy simulation results at both the city and individual building levels. Found that electricity consumption correlates strongly with footprint area, while natural gas consumption is more sensitive to footprint complexity and building type.  
  > - Conducted statistical analysis and visualization of energy simulation outputs, producing insights on the downstream impacts of remote sensing–derived building data. This work contributes directly to my PhD dissertation and will result in a manuscript prepared for journal submission.  
  > - Collaborated with interdisciplinary researchers and project group members, enhancing skills in geospatial analysis, high-performance computing, and applied energy modeling.  
  
- **Intern at Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development**  
  _Jan 2021 - Dec 2022_  
  At the Institute of Geoscience and Natural Resource Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences  
  > - By using GRACE satellite data and MODIS satellite data, we observe the contradiction between agricultural development and water resources under the new patterns of China’s grain production. Satellite data observe that the center of grains production in China is shifting to the northwest, while the water resource is changing in the opposite direction. The contrast between the two may cause an accelerated depletion of agricultural production potential in the already water-scarce north. The project is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: 4217011493. I completed the data download, pre-processing, analysis, plotting, visualization and article writing for the project. The Manuscript is submitted to Remote Sensing and is still under peer review.
  > - Using MODIS fire product to map the temporal and spatial distribution of crop residue burning events in Northeast China (NEC). Providing helpful information at the county level for decision maker to evaluate the effectiveness of staw burning bans policy in NEC.

- **Mapping fine-scale human disturbances in a working landscape with Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine**  
  _2020-2021_  
  At the Ohio State University  
  > We explored the possibility of a Bayesian estimator of abrupt changes, seasonality and trends (BEAST) to capture small-scale disturbances of human activity in a catchment in Ohio as our study area. We found the algorithm can successfully capture the patterns and timings of small-scale disturbances that not captured in the annual land cover maps from Cropland Data Layers—one of the most widely used classification based land dynamics products in the US. I'm responsible for the data pre-processing and visualization, part of the writing. Published at ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.04.008

- **Case Study: how the temperature affects the evaporation process in Tokopah Valley, Nevada**  
  _April 2019_  
  The final project of GEOG 5226 Land Surface Hydrology at OSU  
  > - Tokopah valley is famous for the Tokopah Waterfall. According to some researches, the flow of this waterfall is highly depended on the rainfall and snowfall. I applied 'Modular Distributed Watershed Educational Toolbox' (MOD-WET) to build a watershed model and simulate the surface hydrology conditions here
  > - According to the model, the monthly average discharge reaches its highest value in May. the maximum values of monthly average baseflow appeared from April to May. For visitors at Tokopah Valley, maybe spring is the best season for enjoying a trip there. Visitors may find a gushing waterfall in Tokopah Valley.
  > - According to the report of UCLA, By the end of this century under our current greenhouse gas pathway, temperatures across the Sierra rise by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit ( Climate Change in the Sierra Nevada https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/project/climate-change-sierra-nevada/). According to my simulation, the discharge at the outlet will decrease to 0.3967 from 0.5158 m<sup>3</sup>/h. However, the maximum value is 16.4273 which is higher than before.  The base flow also declined to 1.8480 × 10<sup>-7</sup> m/h.

- **The use of high-resolution remote sensing for plague surveillance in Kazakhstan**  
  _April 2019_  
  The final project of 5225 Introduction to Remote Sensing at OSU  
  > Bubonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is usually spread by fleas. In Kazakhstan, Great Gerbil is a common carrier of fleas. Great Gerbil establishes a star-like pattern of burrow systems. Such systems strongly reflect the sunlight and are visible on satellite images. Each bright disc represents a burrow system 10-40 m in diameter. We used high-resolution satellite images to estimate the range and number of Great Gerbil to provide more information to surveil the spread of the plague in Kazakhstan.

- **Study of a correction method based on linear regression algorithm for PM2.5 sensors**  
  _Jan 2018_  
  At the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science  
  > Inventing a method for correcting PM 2.5 sensors based on linear regression algorithm. Based on accurate data received from PM 2.5 monitoring station near the proximity of the PM 2.5 sensor, the method uses linear regression algorithm to correct the PM 2.5 output value of the sensor, making the output value of the sensor consistent with the accurate value of PM 2.5 from the monitoring station, and therefore achieving the purpose of making the PM 2.5 sensor more accurate and reliable.
