I was born in Nanyang, a medium-sized city located in central China, and spent most of my childhood there. In 2014, I took China’s national college entrance exam and, in the same year, was accepted into the School of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Liaoning University of Technology (LUT), majoring in Environmental Science. In 2018, I graduated from LUT and entered the Environmental Science Graduate Program (ESGP) at Ohio State University (OSU) to pursue a Master’s degree. At ESGP, I chose environmental remote sensing as my research area under the supervision of Dr. Zhao. Two years later, I graduated from OSU and joined the Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Environmental Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGNRR, CAS) as an intern. Currently, I am a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, pursuing a Ph.D. degree and working with Dr. Wu.

As a child, I enjoyed watching BBC Nature documentaries on TV, with ‘Planet Earth’ being my favorite. Starting from elementary school, I often traveled to different places in China during my holidays to experience the various cultures around China. I believe my curiosity about the world and love of nature are what made me choose environmental science.

Outside of academia, I am a beginner in piano, skiing, street dance, and cooking. I love Big Band Jazz music.

My favorite  singers: Lana Del Rey, Sam Cooke and Paloma Faith.

And bands: Queen, Coldplay
