My research interest as an undergraduate is in environmental chemistry. After entering OSU, I changed my research area to environmental remote sensing under the supervision of Dr. Zhao. After graduating from OSU, I joined the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences as an intern, and my main research interest here is agricultural remote sensing.

My research at IGNRR is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China. My first project here is, using GRACE gravity satellite data and MODIS NDVI products to observe the spatial distributions of changes in agricultural development and water resources under the new grain production pattern in China, revealing the contradiction caused by their differences in spatial distribution.

The second topic has just begun. We attempt to use the MODIS Active FIire product to estimate the spatial and time-series change of crop residual burning events in Northeast China from 2015 to 2020. The Chinese government started to implement a straw returning policy in Northeast China in 2017. We hope to observe the changes before and after the policy implementation by using satellite data, evaluating the implementation effect of straw returning policy in Northeast China from a temporal and spatial view.
